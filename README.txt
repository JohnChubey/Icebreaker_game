Icebreaker game

I implemented this game by creating two objects representing the majority of the game. Firstly, I created a "GameBoard" object to handle
most of the game actions and game status. Next, I created a "Player" object to handle all player actions and individual player status.
The "Main" function in the icebreaker_CJ.py file handles all of the overall game logic such as deciding turns and determining when to check
if the game is over. Classes were preferable to using functions due to the overall organization of the project. Also, it seemed natural to
use classes to represent potential real life objects.

To run:
All you have to do to run the game is make sure all files are in the same directory and run the "icebreaker_CJ.py" file.
